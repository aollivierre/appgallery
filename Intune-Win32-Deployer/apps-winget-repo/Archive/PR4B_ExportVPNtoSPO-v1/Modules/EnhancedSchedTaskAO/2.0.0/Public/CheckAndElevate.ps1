function CheckAndElevate {

    <#
.SYNOPSIS
Elevates the script to run with administrative privileges if not already running as an administrator.

.DESCRIPTION
The CheckAndElevate function checks if the current PowerShell session is running with administrative privileges. If it is not, the function attempts to restart the script with elevated privileges using the 'RunAs' verb. This is useful for scripts that require administrative privileges to perform their tasks.

.EXAMPLE
CheckAndElevate

Checks the current session for administrative privileges and elevates if necessary.

.NOTES
This function will cause the script to exit and restart if it is not already running with administrative privileges. Ensure that any state or data required after elevation is managed appropriately.
